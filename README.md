# Sales Forecasting Analysis: Identifying Risks and Opportunities
This project demonstrates the use of SQL to perform sales forecasting analysis based on historical data. The objective is to generate accurate sales forecasts, identify potential risks in the sales pipeline, and uncover growth opportunities across different regions and products.

<B>1. Project Overview </B>:
In this project, I analyze sales forecast data to generate insights that can help in strategic decision-making. The analysis focuses on creating forecasts, assessing potential risks, and comparing forecasted data with actual sales to measure accuracy.

<b>2. Dataset </B>:
The dataset consists of 100 records with the following fields:

<P>Salesperson_ID: Unique identifier for each salesperson.</p>
<p>Forecast_Category: The category of the sales forecast (e.g., Committed, Upside, Uncommitted, Committed at Risk)
</p>
<p>Region: The geographical region where the sale is being made (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America).</p>
<p>Product: The product being sold (e.g., Microsoft 365, Azure, Dynamics 365).</p>
<p>Historical_Sales: Historical sales figures for comparison.</p>
<p>Forecast_Amount: The forecasted sales amount.</p>
<p>Forecast_Date: The date when the forecast was made.</p>

<p><b>3. SQL Queries:
The following SQL queries were used to analyze the dataset: </b>

<p>Some analysis from the queries:

1. Forecast Accuracy
Approach: Compare the forecasted sales amounts with the historical sales to assess accuracy.
Key Observations:
Europe - Surface Laptop (ID: 1013): Forecasted at 5143.65 but historical sales were 23842. The forecast significantly underestimated the sales, showing potential underconfidence in the forecast.
North America - LinkedIn (ID: 1031): Forecasted at 5100.32 but actual sales were 43043.80. This also indicates an underestimation.
Asia-Pacific - Microsoft 365 (ID: 1047): Forecasted at 38772.72, actual sales were 47785.41. This is relatively accurate, indicating good forecasting in this case.
2. Risk Identification
Approach: Identify and highlight the forecasts categorized as "Committed at Risk" to understand potential problem areas.
Key Risk Areas:
Asia-Pacific - Visual Studio (ID: 1022): Forecasted at 35404.30, but actual sales were 25172.98. A large deviation, indicating a high risk that the committed forecast may not be met.
North America - LinkedIn (ID: 1019): Forecasted at 11142.38, but actual sales were 57577.83. While actual sales are much higher, the low forecast compared to historical sales suggests an uncertainty or potential risk in this forecast.
Europe - Teams (ID: 1023): Forecasted at 42344.14, actual sales were 52808. This is relatively accurate, but the risk categorization suggests the need for close monitoring.
3. Growth Opportunities
Approach: Focus on regions and products with the highest forecasted sales to identify growth strategies.
Key Opportunities:
Asia-Pacific - Windows 11 (ID: 1015): Forecasted at 46396.53, indicating strong expected growth in this region for this product.
Europe - Edge (ID: 1048): Forecasted at 42575.88, highlighting potential growth in Europe.
North America - Xbox (ID: 1023): Forecasted at 48272.68, showing a high potential for growth in the North American market for this product.
<p><b>Summary of Insights:</b></p>
Forecast Accuracy: There are several instances where the forecasts significantly underestimate the actual sales, suggesting a need for improving forecasting models or gathering more accurate data.
Risk Identification: Some "Committed at Risk" forecasts have large discrepancies between forecasted and historical sales, which may require targeted interventions or risk mitigation strategies.
Growth Opportunities: Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America show strong potential for products like Windows 11, Edge, and Xbox, which should be areas of focus for growth strategies.</p>

<p>Based on the analysis conducted in this project, several key insights have emerged regarding the sales pipeline and forecasting:

1. **Forecast Accuracy**:
   - The comparison between forecasted and actual sales reveals varying levels of forecast accuracy across different regions and products. Significant discrepancies were identified, particularly in the "Committed at Risk" category, where the actual sales often fell short of the forecasted amounts. This highlights the need for more refined forecasting models and closer monitoring of at-risk opportunities to improve accuracy.

2. **Risk Identification**:
   - The identification of sales forecasts categorized as "Committed at Risk" has been instrumental in pinpointing potential problem areas. Regions like Asia-Pacific and Latin America, along with products such as Visual Studio, LinkedIn, and Teams, frequently appeared in this category. These insights can help sales teams focus their efforts on mitigating risks and addressing challenges in these specific segments.

3. **Growth Opportunities**:
   - Analysis of forecasted sales identified regions and products with the highest growth potential. North America and Europe emerged as key regions, with products like Exchange, SQL Server, and Minecraft showing promising forecasted sales. These areas present significant opportunities for strategic investment and growth initiatives.

**Conclusion**:
This project underscores the importance of accurate sales forecasting, risk management, and growth opportunity identification in driving sales productivity and operational efficiency. The findings suggest that focusing on improving forecast accuracy, particularly for at-risk categories, and capitalizing on identified growth opportunities can lead to enhanced sales performance. Moving forward, the insights gained from this analysis can inform strategic decision-making, resource allocation, and targeted sales efforts to optimize overall sales outcomes.</p>
