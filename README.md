# Sales-Forecasting-Analysis-with-SQL
This project demonstrates the use of SQL to perform sales forecasting analysis based on historical data. The objective is to generate accurate sales forecasts, identify potential risks in the sales pipeline, and uncover growth opportunities across different regions and products.

1. Project Overview:
In this project, I analyze sales forecast data to generate insights that can help in strategic decision-making. The analysis focuses on creating forecasts, assessing potential risks, and comparing forecasted data with actual sales to measure accuracy.

2. Dataset:
The dataset consists of 100 records with the following fields:

Salesperson_ID: Unique identifier for each salesperson.
Forecast_Category: The category of the sales forecast (e.g., Committed, Upside, Uncommitted, Committed at Risk).
Region: The geographical region where the sale is being made (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America).
Product: The product being sold (e.g., Microsoft 365, Azure, Dynamics 365).
Historical_Sales: Historical sales figures for comparison.
Forecast_Amount: The forecasted sales amount.
Forecast_Date: The date when the forecast was made.
